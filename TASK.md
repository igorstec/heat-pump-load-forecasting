## Predictive Grid Management for Heat Pump Networks

### Background & Context

The mass electrification of heating in Poland is a cornerstone of the energy transition. However, for Distribution System Operators (DSOs), the rapid influx of heat pumps creates significant challenges. Precise forecasting of aggregated power demand is essential to prevent grid overloads and ensure system stability. This challenge focuses on high-resolution data analysis to predict seasonal grid strain.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this challenge is to develop a high-precision predictive system that utilizes historical data from 2024 to forecast the total electrical load for the summer-autumn of 2025. This is an extrapolation task; participants must build models capable of projecting learned behaviors into a new year.

* Timeframe: Forecast May-October 2025 (6 months per device).
* Task Nature: This is an extrapolative challenge. Models must be designed to project demand beyond the provided historical training scope, accounting for shifting patterns in device behavior.
* Objective: Architect a system that generates precise per-device monthly load forecasts.

### Data Specification

The dataset provided is of high resolution, requiring efficient data handling:

* Frequency: Data is recorded at 5-minute intervals.
* Data Management: Due to the substantial volume of data, teams are expected to "slice" or subsample the dataset for efficient training and model development.
* No Synthesis: The dataset consists of real-world telemetry; there is no requirement for generating additional synthetic data.

### Feature Reference

*data.csv* – time-series telemetry, one row per device per 5-minute interval:

| Column | Feature | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| deviceId | Device ID | Unique identifier for each unit. | 
| Timedate | Timestamp | UTC timestamp of the 5-minute reading. |

| x1 | Operating frequency | Compressor/device operating frequency. | 
| x2 | Grid load indicator | Individual electrical grid load index *(prediction target)*. | 
| x3 | Heating curve type | Type of heating curve configuration used by the device. | 
| deviceType | Device type | Integer-encoded device category. | 

*devices.csv* – static per-device metadata:

| Column | Feature | Descripton | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| deviceId | Device ID | Unique identifier for each unit (join key). | 
| latitude | Latitude | Geographic latitude of the device installation site. | 
| longitude | Longitude | Geographic longitude of the device installation site. | 

### Prediction Target

For each device $d$ and forecast month $m$, predict the **average x2** over all 5-minute readings within that month:

$$
target_{d,m} = \frac{1}{N_{d,m}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{d,m}} x_2^{(d,m,i)}
$$

where $N_{d,m}$ is the total number of readings for device $d$ in month $m$.

### Submission Format

Submit a single CSV file covering **both validation and test months** — one row per device per month:

```csv
deviceId,year,month,prediction
000cc3cb...,2025,5,0.18908
000cc3cb...,2025,6,0.18908
000cc3cb...,2025,7,0.21034
...
```

| Column | Type | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| deviceId | str | Device identifier (matches training data) | 
| year | int | Year of the forecast month | 
| Month | int | Month number (5–10 for May–October 2025) | 
| prediction | float | Predicted average x2 for that device and month | 

### Evaluation Metrics

Submissions are evaluated using MAE (Mean Absolute Error):

$$
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vert{}y_i - \hat{y}_i\vert{}
$$

where $n$ is the total number of predictions. Lower values indicate better predictions, and a score of 0 corresponds to a perfect prediction.

### Leaderboard vs. Final Score

| Score | Months used | Weights |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Leaderboard (visible) | Validation only (May – Jun 2025) | - |
| Final score | Validation + Test (May – Oct 2025) | 2/6 valid 4/6 test |

In order to be included in the final leaderboard, a reproducible code implementation for generating the submission should be provided, in a form of a link to public GitHub repository.
